                    <h2>Description:</h2>
                        <p>Ragu is the perfect combination of a delicious tomato sauce seasoned and flavored with meats, garlic, and onions. Perfect for a bowl of home made pasta.</p>
                        <p>This recipe can be simply modified into a classic bolognese to compliment a traditional lasagna.</p>
                <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>1lb Ground beef (80/20)</li>
                        <li>1lb Mild Italian sausage</li>
                        <li>1 large white onion</li>
                        <li>6 cloves of garlic</li>
                        <li>1 can of tomato paste (8oz)</li>
                        <li>1 to 2 cups of red wine (your preference, cheap wine works fine)</li>
                        <li>2 28oz cans of crushed tomatoes</li>
                        <li>1 can of dice tomatoes </li>
                        <li>3 tablespoons of italian seasoning (or to taste)</li>
                        <li>Salt to taste</li>
                        <li>Black pepper to taste</li>
                    </ul>
                <h2>Steps:</h2>
                    <ol>
                        <li>In a dutch oven brown the sausage and ground beef together over medium high heat. Once the meat is browned use a slotted spoon or strainer to remove the meat and set aside.</li>
                        <li>Fill the bottom of the pan with olive oil and turn heat to medium-low, add the onion and brown until caramelized. You'll want to let this cook for about 15 minutes to get a good caramelization.</li>
                        <li>Add the garlic and cook for 1 to 2 minutes.</li>
                        <li>Make a well in the center of the pan, add the can of tomato paste and slowly mix into the onions and garlic (slightly frying the tomato paste).</li>
                        <li>Add the red wine, important to cover all of the onion mixture and have some room to reduce (you'll get the feel for it after making a few batches).</li>
                        <li>Let reduce by half (enjoy a glass of the red wine while you wait!).</li>
                        <li>Once the wine is reduced add the canned tomatoes, meat that was set aside, and italian seasoning.</li>
                        <li>Let stew for 30 minutes to a half an hour. Season with salt and black pepper to taste.</li>
                        <li>Cook your favorite pasta and serve (the best pasta for ragu is wider noodles such as Pappardelle or Rigatoni).</li>
                    </ol>
                <h2>Bolognese Variation:</h2>
                <p>If you want to make a bolognese. Simply add 2 carrots and 2 celery ribs, place them in the food processor with the onion and finely mince them, then cook them at the same time you'd cool the onion.</p>
